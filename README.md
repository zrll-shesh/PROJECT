##Customer Churn Analysis##
End-to-End Data Science Project (MySQL to Machine Learning)

Overview
This project is an end-to-end Customer Churn Analysis that simulates a real-world company workflow.
Instead of starting from a static CSV file, the project begins at the database level, reflecting how data is commonly generated, stored, and processed in an enterprise environment.
The workflow covers database creation, data generation, data extraction, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling using LightGBM.
